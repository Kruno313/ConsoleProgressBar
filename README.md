# ConsoleProgressBar
Console-ProgressBar for .NET

I needed progress bar which allows me to write messages below active progress bar, and was not able to find some.<br/>
So I wrote one my self, using ideas of some other similar.<br/>
It allows You to change the caret used to show the progress, the color of the bar, the bar-background and the percentage-text, as well as the width of the bar (You can use int.MaxValue to use whole console window width).<br/>
Those and other settings are specified in the Options class.<br/>
For the example see Program.cs, which was part of my test application.
